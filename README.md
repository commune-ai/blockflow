blockflow is a GUI for [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), designed with [react-flow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow) to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows with drag-and-drop components and a chat box.

## 📦 Installation

You can install blockflow from pip:

`pip install blockflow`

Next, run:

`python -m blockflow` or just `blockflow`

## 🎨 Creating Flows

Creating flows with blockflow is easy. Simply drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline. blockflow provides a range of [LangChain components](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html) to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.

Explore by editing prompt parameters, link chains and agents, track an agent's thought process, and export your flow.
